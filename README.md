# Overview of C++ programming (FILE MANAGEMENT)
TOOL
1. The program performs basic file operations: writing, reading, and appending data to files.  
2. It uses the `<fstream>` library in C++ for file handling.  
3. First, the user is prompted to enter a filename to write data.  
4. The program writes the entered data into the specified file, overwriting existing content.  
5. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is displayed.  
6. Next, the program asks for a filename to read data.  
7. It reads and displays the file content line by line.  
8. If the file cannot be opened for reading, an error message is shown.  
9. Lastly, the user is prompted to enter a filename to append data.  
10. The entered data is added to the end of the file without overwriting.  
11. If the file cannot be opened for appending, an error is displayed.  
12. `std::ofstream` is used for writing and appending files.  
13. `std::ifstream` is used for reading files.  
14. The program uses `getline()` to handle multi-word input.  
15. It employs `ios::app` mode to append data without affecting existing content.  
16. Proper error handling ensures the program doesnâ€™t crash on file issues.  
17. The `cin.ignore()` is used to clear the input buffer before reading strings.  
18. Data is displayed in the console for confirmation after each operation.  
19. The program provides a simple interface for file operations.  
20. It demonstrates the basics of file handling in a user-friendly way.
